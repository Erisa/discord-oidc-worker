# Discord OIDC Provider for Cloudflare Access

Simply put: Allows you to authorise with Cloudflare Access using your Discord account via a Cloudflare Worker. Wraps OIDC around the Discord OAuth2 API to achieve this, storing signing keys in KV. 

Process flow was inspired by [kimcore/discord-oidc](https://github.com/kimcore/discord-oidc) but rewritten entirely by [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Hono](https://honojs.dev/).

Some ideas were also taken from [eidam/cf-access-workers-oidc](https://github.com/eidam/cf-access-workers-oidc).

## Setup

Requirements:
- A Cloudflare Access account - make sure you've gone through the onboarding flow and have a `NAME.cloudflareaccess.com` subddomain.
- A [Discord developer application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to use for OAuth2.
    - Add a redirect URI `https://YOURNAME.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback` to the Discord application.
- NodeJS

Steps:
- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Create a KV namespace on Cloudflare [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces).
- Edit `wrangler.toml` to use your new KV namespace ID.
- Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`.
- Add your Discord application ID and OAuth2 secret to `config.json`.
- Edit your Cloudflare Access subdomain into `config.json` under `redirectURL`. This should be the same URL you added to Discord.
- Publish the Worker with `npx wrangler publish`!

## Usage

- Go to the [Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com)
- Navigate to Settings > Authentication, select "Add new" under Login methods, select OpenID Connect.
- Fill the following fields:
    - Name: Whatever you want, e.g. `Discord`
    - App ID: Your Discord application ID.
    - Client secret: Your Discord application OAuth2 secret.
    - Auth URL: `https://discord-oidc.YOURNAME.workers.dev/authorize/email` or swap out `/email` for `/guilds` to include the Guilds scope.
    - Token URL:  `https://discord-oidc.YOURNAME.workers.dev/token`
    - Certificate URL: `https://discord-oidc.YOURNAME.workers.dev/jwks.json`
    - Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE): Enabled
    - OIDC Claims:
        - Email is included automatically without being set here.
        - `preferred_username` will map to the users name + discrim e.g. `Erisa#9999`
        - If the Auth URL is `/guilds` then the `guilds` claim can be used toprovide a list of guild IDs.
        - Anything else from here will work: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-user-structure
- See the Examples section below for help with constructing policies.

## Usage with roles
- Follow the above setup, making sure to use the `/guilds` auth URL.
- Create a Discord Bot for the OAuth2 application, generate an OAuth2 URL with the `bot` scope and use it to invite the bot to your server.
    - The bot does not need any permissions, it just needs to exist in the server.
- Generate a bot token and paste it into `npx wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN`.
- Populate `config.json` with a list of server IDs that you wish to check user roles for. **Make sure the bot is a member of all servers in this list**.
- Edit the OIDC provider in Cloudflare Access and add the server IDs as claims prefixed with `roles:`, e.g. `roles:438781053675634713`
- When creating a policy, reference the `roles:` claims as the name, and use the role ID as the claim value. This will match users in that server who have that role.

Example config for a roles setup:
```json
{
    "clientId": "1056005449054429204",
    "clientSecret": "aaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "redirectURL": "https://erisa.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback",
    "serversToCheckRolesFor": [
        "438781053675634713"
    ]
}
```

## Examples
My setup, as an example:

To use this in a policy, simply enable it as an Identity provider in your Access application and then create a rule using `OIDC Claims` and the relevant claim above. Make sure the claim has been added to your provider in the steps above.

With roles:

This example would allow me to access the application if I was myself on Discord or if I was a member of a specific server:
